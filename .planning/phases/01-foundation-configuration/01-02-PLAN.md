<objective>
Deploy the configured Next.js 15 project to Vercel with automatic Git-based deployment, and verify the production URL serves the site correctly.

Purpose: Close the deployment loop so every future phase can be verified in production immediately after execution. Auto-deploy from Git means zero deployment friction for the entire project lifecycle.
Output: A live production URL that auto-updates on every Git push, verified working with HTTPS.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Prepare repository for deployment and push to remote</name>
  <files>
    .gitignore
    package.json
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Ensure `.gitignore` includes `.vercel` directory (Vercel CLI creates this locally)
    2. Stage all project files and create initial commit:
       ```bash
       git add -A
       git commit -m "feat(01): initialize Next.js 15 project with full configuration"
       ```
    3. If no remote is configured, prompt user for their GitHub repository URL. If remote exists, push:
       ```bash
       git push origin main
       ```
       (If the branch is `master`, push to `master` instead.)

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT push `.env.local` -- verify with `git status` that it is properly gitignored before committing.

    4. After push, attempt Vercel CLI deployment:
       ```bash
       npx vercel --yes
       ```
       If this fails due to authentication, this is expected -- the checkpoint task below handles it.
       If Vercel CLI is not installed or auth fails, that is fine. User will link via dashboard.

  </action>
  <verify>
    1. `git log --oneline -1` shows the initial commit
    2. `git status` shows clean working tree (nothing unstaged)
    3. `.env.local` does NOT appear in git log (run `git show --stat HEAD` to verify)
  </verify>
  <done>
    Project code is committed to Git and pushed to remote repository. No secrets are in the commit history. Repository is ready for Vercel import.

  <what-built>
    The complete Next.js 15 project has been scaffolded, configured, and pushed to Git. It includes:
    - Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
    - metadataBase configured for SEO metadata
    - ESLint + Prettier for code quality
    - Environment variable scoping (.env.local for secrets, .env.example for template)
    - Proper .gitignore excluding secrets, build artifacts, and dependencies

    The project needs to be connected to Vercel for auto-deployment.

  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. If Vercel CLI deployment succeeded in Task 1:
       - Visit the deployment URL printed in the terminal output
       - Verify the page shows "Reiki Practice" heading with styled text
       - Check HTTPS works (green lock icon in browser)

    2. If Vercel CLI was not authenticated (expected for first time):
       - Go to https://vercel.com and sign in (or create account)
       - Click "Add New" -> "Project"
       - Import the Git repository that was just pushed
       - Click "Deploy" (no configuration needed -- Vercel auto-detects Next.js)
       - Wait for build to complete (~1 minute)
       - Visit the production URL
       - Verify "Reiki Practice" heading appears with Tailwind styling

    3. Verify auto-deploy works:
       - The next time code is pushed to Git, Vercel should auto-deploy
       - Check Vercel dashboard shows the deployment as "Production"

    4. Share the production URL so it can be recorded in project state.

  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "deployed" followed by the production URL (e.g., "deployed https://reiki-landing.vercel.app"), or describe any issues encountered.</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After deployment is confirmed:

```bash
# 1. Verify production URL responds
curl -I https://YOUR_PRODUCTION_URL
# Expected: HTTP 200, content-type: text/html

# 2. Verify auto-deploy is active
# Check Vercel Dashboard -> Project -> Settings -> Git
# Should show connected repository with auto-deploy enabled

# 3. Verify build logs are clean
# Check Vercel Dashboard -> Project -> Deployments -> Latest
# Build should show zero errors, zero warnings (or only Next.js informational messages)
```

</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Production URL serves the Next.js landing page over HTTPS
- Vercel build logs show zero errors
- Auto-deploy is connected to Git repository
- Page displays "Reiki Practice" heading with Tailwind CSS styling at production URL
- No secrets (.env.local values) are exposed in the deployment
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-configuration/01-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
