<objective>
Build the Benefits, Pricing, and Trust sections -- the bottom half of the landing page that converts visitors from understanding to action.

Purpose: After learning about Reiki (Plan 02), visitors need to see specific benefits (emotional hook), transparent pricing (removes cost uncertainty), and trust signals (credibility). This is the conversion funnel: Benefits create desire, Trust removes doubt, Pricing enables decision.
Output: BenefitsSection.tsx, PricingSection.tsx, TrustSection.tsx components, composed into page.tsx completing the full landing page content.

**BenefitsSection.tsx (Server Component -- NO 'use client'):**
Create a Benefits & Effects section showcasing what Reiki can help with:

- `<section id="benefits">` with section padding (py-20)
- Cream/off-white background (alternating from white How It Works section)
- Centered `<h2>` "Benefits & Effects" with heading font, text-3xl md:text-4xl
- Brief intro paragraph (centered, max-w-3xl mx-auto) explaining these are commonly reported benefits

- Benefits grid: 6 benefits in a grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 or gap-8)
  Each benefit card:
  - Icon area: Use a simple emoji or Unicode symbol as placeholder (a colored circle with icon-like character). Keep it simple -- no icon library dependency.
  - Title: font-semibold, text-lg
  - Description: text-neutral-600, 2-3 sentences

  Benefits to include:
  1. "Stress Relief" -- Reiki promotes deep relaxation, helping release tension and reduce the physical and emotional effects of stress
  2. "Emotional Balance" -- Sessions can help process difficult emotions, creating a sense of calm and emotional stability
  3. "Better Sleep" -- Many clients report improved sleep quality and easier ability to relax before bedtime
  4. "Pain Management" -- Reiki may help reduce discomfort and support the body's natural pain management processes
  5. "Mental Clarity" -- Experience clearer thinking, improved focus, and a greater sense of presence and awareness
  6. "Energy Restoration" -- Feel revitalized as Reiki helps restore the natural flow and balance of your body's energy

- Each card: White background (bg-white), rounded-xl, shadow-sm, padding p-6 or p-8, subtle hover shadow transition
- Add a small disclaimer note below the grid: "Results vary by individual. Reiki is a complementary practice and should not replace professional medical advice." Use text-sm, text-neutral-500, italic, centered.
