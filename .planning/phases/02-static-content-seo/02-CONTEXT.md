# Phase 2: Static Content & SEO - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Build a complete premium landing page with hero section, informational content sections (About Reiki, Benefits, How Sessions Work, Methodology), pricing information, trust signals, and SEO optimization. Rendered as static HTML for speed and search visibility.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Section Design
- **Background**: Claude's discretion — choose based on performance and design best practices
- **Headline approach**: Benefit-focused messaging (e.g., "Find Balance and Inner Peace Through Reiki Healing")
- **Primary CTA text**: "Schedule Consultation" (professional, appointment-focused)
- **Layout structure**: Left-aligned content (text on left, visual space on right for asymmetric split)

### Content Sections Layout
- **Section width**: Full-width backgrounds with alternating background colors, content centered within each section
- **Internal layout**: Mixed approach — different layouts for different sections based on content type (text + image splits, grids, single column as appropriate)
- **Section order**: About Reiki → How Sessions Work → Benefits & Effects → Pricing
- **Transitions**: Alternating rhythm — varying backgrounds and layouts create visual rhythm between sections

### Pricing Presentation
- **Display format**: Card-based layout for services/packages
- **Number of tiers**: Claude's discretion — design based on conversion optimization
- **Featured option**: Claude's discretion — decide based on conversion best practices
- **Scientific disclaimer**: Claude's discretion — balance legal compliance with user experience

### Claude's Discretion
- Hero background selection (static image, video, or gradient)
- Specific pricing tier structure and package combinations
- Whether to highlight a "recommended" or "best value" pricing option
- Scientific disclaimer placement and styling
- Loading states and skeleton designs
- Exact spacing, typography hierarchy, and micro-interactions
- Image optimization and lazy loading strategy
- SEO metadata specifics (titles, descriptions, structured data)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Hero should create immediate visual impact while maintaining fast load times
- Section ordering prioritizes education (About → Process → Benefits) before conversion (Pricing)
- Alternating rhythm keeps visual interest during scroll
- Professional tone with "Schedule Consultation" CTA positions service as expert practice
