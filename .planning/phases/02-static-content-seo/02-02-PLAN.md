<objective>
Build the Hero section, About Reiki section, and How Sessions Work section -- the top half of the landing page that educates visitors and creates emotional engagement.

Purpose: These are the first three things visitors see. The hero creates impact and captures attention. About Reiki educates on what the practice is. How It Works removes uncertainty by explaining the session process. Together they move visitors from curiosity to understanding.
Output: Hero.tsx, AboutSection.tsx, HowItWorksSection.tsx components, composed into page.tsx with proper section ordering.

  <name>Task 1: Hero section with background image</name>
  <files>
    app/_components/Hero.tsx
    public/images/hero-bg.jpg
  </files>
  <action>
**Hero background image:**
Download a high-quality, royalty-free image suitable for a Reiki/healing/wellness landing page. Use a calming, premium image -- options:
- Peaceful nature scene (water, mountains, sunrise)
- Soft abstract healing energy (light, warmth)
- Zen/meditation environment (stones, candles, calm)

Use Unsplash (configured in next.config.ts remotePatterns) or save a placeholder image to `public/images/hero-bg.jpg`. For build reliability, save a local placeholder: create a simple gradient image or download and save locally. If downloading fails, create a CSS gradient fallback in the hero component.

**Hero.tsx (Server Component -- NO 'use client'):**
Create a full-viewport hero section:

- Structure:
  - `<section id="hero" className="relative h-screen flex items-center">`
  - Background: Use `next/image` with `fill` and `priority` props for the hero image. Add a dark overlay (absolute positioned div with bg-black/40 or similar) for text readability.
  - Content positioned with `relative z-10`:
    - Left-aligned layout per CONTEXT.md decision (text on left, visual space on right for asymmetric split)
    - Container: max-w-7xl mx-auto, padding
    - Headline: `<h1>` with heading font, text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl, white text, text-balance
      - Text: "Find Balance and Inner Peace Through Reiki Healing"
    - Subheadline: `<p>` text-xl md:text-2xl, white/90 opacity, max-w-2xl
      - Text: "Professional energy healing sessions to help you release stress, restore harmony, and reconnect with your inner well-being"
    - CTA: Import and render `<CTAButton variant="hero" text="Schedule Consultation" targetId="pricing" />`
  - Responsive: Full screen on all devices, text scales down on mobile

- Performance:
  - Image uses `priority` prop (LCP candidate -- only image on page with priority)
  - Image uses `fill` + `className="object-cover"` for responsive background
  - Provide `sizes="100vw"` for proper srcset generation
  - Include `placeholder="blur"` with a small blurDataURL if using local image (generate a base64 blur placeholder)

- Accessibility:
  - Meaningful alt text on hero image
  - h1 is the only h1 on the page (other sections use h2)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` -- must succeed.
Verify Hero.tsx does NOT have 'use client' directive.
Verify the image uses `priority` prop.
Verify there is exactly one `<h1>` element in the Hero.
  </verify>
  <done>Hero.tsx renders a full-screen section with background image (priority, optimized), dark overlay, left-aligned headline "Find Balance and Inner Peace Through Reiki Healing", subheadline, and hero-variant CTA button. Build passes.</done>

  <name>Task 2: About Reiki and How Sessions Work sections</name>
  <files>
    app/_components/AboutSection.tsx
    app/_components/HowItWorksSection.tsx
    app/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**AboutSection.tsx (Server Component):**
Create the About Reiki educational section:
- `<section id="about">` with section padding (py-section from design tokens, or py-20)
- Alternating background: Use a cream/off-white surface color to contrast with white hero
- Layout: Two-column on desktop (text left, visual right), single column on mobile
  - Left column (lg:w-3/5):
    - `<h2>` "About Reiki" with heading font, text-3xl md:text-4xl
    - Paragraph content explaining what Reiki is: its Japanese origin ("Rei" = universal, "Ki" = life energy), the practice of channeling energy through hands, founded by Mikao Usui, used worldwide for relaxation and well-being
    - Second paragraph on principles: Reiki as a complementary practice, non-invasive, works with body's natural healing
    - Use text-lg, leading-relaxed for readability
  - Right column (lg:w-2/5):
    - A decorative element or placeholder for an image. Use a styled div with a calming gradient or rounded shape as a visual accent. Actual practitioner photo can be added later.
- Semantic HTML: Use `<article>` within the section for the content block

**HowItWorksSection.tsx (Server Component):**
Create the session process section:
- `<section id="how-it-works">` with section padding
- White background (contrasting with cream About section)
- Layout: Centered content with step-by-step process
  - `<h2>` "How a Session Works" with heading font, text-3xl md:text-4xl, centered
  - Brief intro paragraph (centered, max-w-3xl mx-auto)
  - 3-4 steps displayed as a numbered timeline or card grid:
    - Step 1: "Consultation" -- Brief discussion of your goals, health history, and what to expect
    - Step 2: "Preparation" -- You relax fully clothed on a comfortable treatment table in a peaceful environment
    - Step 3: "Energy Work" -- Gentle hand placement on or above the body, channeling healing energy to areas of tension
    - Step 4: "Integration" -- Time to absorb the experience, followed by a brief discussion of sensations and next steps
  - Each step: Number/icon, title (font-semibold), description paragraph
  - Use a grid layout (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8) for the steps
  - Each step card: Subtle border or shadow, rounded corners, padding, hover effect (slight shadow increase via Tailwind)

**page.tsx updates:**
- Import Hero, AboutSection, HowItWorksSection
- Compose them in the correct order per CONTEXT.md: Hero -> About -> How It Works
- Remove the placeholder anchor divs for "hero", "about", "how-it-works" (now handled by actual section ids)
- Keep remaining anchor divs for sections not yet built: "benefits", "pricing", "contact"
- Page remains a Server Component (no 'use client')
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` -- must succeed with zero errors.
Verify page.tsx imports and renders Hero, AboutSection, HowItWorksSection in order.
Verify all three section components are Server Components (no 'use client').
Verify each section has the correct id attribute for nav anchor links.
  </verify>
  <done>
- AboutSection.tsx renders educational content about Reiki with two-column layout and cream background
- HowItWorksSection.tsx renders 4-step process as card grid with white background
- page.tsx composes Hero -> About -> How It Works in correct order
- All sections have correct id attributes matching header nav links
- All components are Server Components, build passes
  </done>
