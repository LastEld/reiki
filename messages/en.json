  "About": {
    "title": "About Reiki",
    "p1": "Reiki is a Japanese healing practice that channels universal life energy through gentle hand placement. The word Reiki comes from two Japanese words: <strong>Rei</strong> (universal) and <strong>Ki</strong> (life energy). Founded by Mikao Usui in the early 20th century, Reiki has since been practiced worldwide as a complementary approach to wellness and relaxation.",
    "p2": "During a Reiki session, a trained practitioner places their hands lightly on or just above the body, allowing the natural flow of energy to support the body's innate healing processes. Reiki is non-invasive, gentle, and deeply relaxing.",
    "p3": "As a complementary practice, Reiki works alongside conventional medical care to promote balance, reduce stress, and support overall well-being. It is not a substitute for professional medical treatment, but rather a holistic approach to nurturing harmony between mind, body, and spirit."

  "FAQ": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Find answers to common questions about Reiki healing and what to expect.",
    "q1": "What is Reiki and how does it work?",
    "a1": "Reiki is a Japanese energy healing technique developed in the early 20th century. During a session, the practitioner places their hands lightly on or just above the body to channel universal life energy. This gentle process promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and supports the body's natural healing processes.",
    "q2": "What should I expect during my first session?",
    "a2": "Your first session begins with a brief consultation to discuss your goals and any concerns. You'll remain fully clothed and lie comfortably on a treatment table. The session lasts about 60 minutes, during which you may feel warmth, tingling, or deep relaxation. Many people feel calm and refreshed afterward.",
    "q3": "How many sessions do I need?",
    "a3": "The number of sessions varies depending on your goals. Some people feel significant benefits after a single session, while others prefer regular sessions for ongoing wellness. I typically recommend starting with 3 sessions to fully experience the benefits, and we'll discuss a personalized plan during your consultation.",
    "q4": "Is Reiki safe? Are there any side effects?",
    "a4": "Reiki is a non-invasive, gentle practice considered safe for people of all ages. There are no known negative side effects. Some people may experience mild emotional release or feel temporarily tired after a session, which is a normal part of the body's relaxation response.",
    "q5": "Can Reiki replace medical treatment?",
    "a5": "No. Reiki is a complementary practice that works alongside conventional medical treatment, not as a replacement. It can support your overall well-being and help manage stress, but you should always consult your healthcare provider for medical concerns.",
    "q6": "How do I prepare for a session?",
    "a6": "Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. Avoid heavy meals or caffeine right before the session. Come with an open mind and be ready to relax. It's helpful to drink water before and after the session to support your body's natural processes.",
    "q7": "Do you offer online or distance Reiki sessions?",
    "a7": "Currently, all sessions are offered in-person at my practice in Zürich. In-person sessions allow for the most effective energy work and the best experience for both new and returning clients."
